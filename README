**This project requires Python 3.10 to be installed.**

You can check this by running "python --version" or "python3 --version". You should be using at least Python 3.10.0 (sadly, lectura only has 3.8 so you cannot run it there).

If you don't have Python 3.10 installed, you should be able to install it via your package manager (apt, homebrew, etc.) or from https://python.org/downloads/

Alternatively, you can use the "pyenv" software to create a virtual Python environment. See the following link for more details: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation
