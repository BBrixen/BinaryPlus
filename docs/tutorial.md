# Binary Plus Tutorial

## Hello World

All files end with `.binp`. Here is an example `hello_world.binp`:
```
output Hello World!
```

To run this program, from the command line, type:
```bash
$ python binp.py path/to/hello_World.binp
 >> Hello World!
```

## Variable Assignment

TODO Write

Syntax is as follows:

```
var <type> <variableName> = <value>
```

Valid types are:

- `bool` (boolean)
- `int` (integer)
- `str` (string)
- `func` (function; discussed later)

Booleans can be `true`, `True`, `false`, or `False`  
Integers can be any number. However, defining negative numbers must be done through subtraction. 

Variables can be re-defiend and their types are able to change with the re-definition
