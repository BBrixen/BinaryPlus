$ most basic function. takes no arguments and returns nothing
$ note: we put '' around printer because otherwise it will print out the definition of this function
var null func printer = () =>
    output you have called the 'printer'
    output x
end printer

$ calling a function with no arguments
printer()

$ now when we call the function, it has the value of x in its namespace
var int x = 10
printer()
