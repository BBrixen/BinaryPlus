$ casting and changing types
$ we cannot change between ints and booleans tho
var int x = 10
output 'x as an int is' x
$ BENNETT: FIX THIS ITS STILL BROKEN
var str x = x
output 'x as a str is' x

$ BENNETT: if this is broken then i need to add | 0 and | 1 to the boolean replacement
$ boolean inference from integers
var str x = True
var bool x = x
output x

$ boolean expressions
var bool x = True && False
output x

$ integer expressions
var int x = 10 - 7 * 5 + 10
output x
